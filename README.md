Testing the robin-stocks python connectivity
robinFirst.py just tests some of the different methods
stockPy.py will trade your stocks and sell the stock which is going up the most in the last hour and buy a share of the stock that is going down the most. I am working on testing this out with different pennystocks in order to figure out if it can beat the market on a small scale.
